    $mn_migration_master$> **Who moved, why, and what it made.** Humans have always moved; the scale, the compulsion and the paperwork have changed. This chapter follows the forced diasporas of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean slave trades; the Indian and Chinese labour migrations that followed abolition; the three great streams of the century after 1840, Asian as well as European; the Jewish, Armenian and Lebanese diasporas; the racial borders, passports and refugee regimes built after the 1880s and 1914; the "unmixing" of peoples from Lausanne to Partition; guest workers and post-colonial arrivals; and the remittances and diaspora politics of today. It also follows the historians' arguments, from what counts as a diaspora to whether migrants were uprooted or transplanted.

## A Species on the Move

Migration is older than history. As the chapter on Human Origins describes, the dispersal of *Homo sapiens* that produced nearly all living non-Africans came sometime after about 60,000 years ago. Later movements reshaped whole continents: the spread of Bantu-speaking peoples out of a homeland in north-western Cameroon and south-eastern Nigeria, described in the chapter on sub-Saharan Africa to 1860, and the Austronesian voyages that began from Taiwan around 5,000 years ago, told in the chapter on Pacific Voyagers.

Historians have long dismantled the image of a static past that began to move only with industrialisation. In 1971 **Wilbur Zelinsky** proposed a "mobility transition" in step with the demographic transition, from a premodern stage of low migration to "massive movement from the countryside to cities". **Jan and Leo Lucassen** challenged that starting point. Counting seasonal and temporary workers, soldiers, sailors and colonists as well as settlers, they measured "cross-cultural migration rates" for Europe from 1501 to 1900 and found a highly mobile continent; a later volume extended the measure to Russia, China and Japan and described "a common start, a long divergence and a recent convergence". Global surveys by **Patrick Manning**, from early hominids to today, and **Dirk Hoerder**, across a thousand years on every continent, likewise treat movement as normal.

## The First Diaspora

The word itself carries an image. *Diaspora* comes from the Greek *diaspeirō*, "I scatter, I spread about", built on *speirō*, "I sow": a scattering of seed. Its first recorded use is in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, at Deuteronomy 28:25, which warns, "thou shalt be a dispersion in all kingdoms of the earth".

The Jewish experience gave the word its first meaning. The Assyrians deported many Israelites to Mesopotamia in 722 BCE, and after Nebuchadnezzar II deported much of Judah's population in 586 BCE Jewish life had two centres, Babylonia and the land of Israel, as the chapter on Ancient Israel and the Levant describes. A popular story holds that the diaspora began when Rome expelled the Jews after crushing the revolts of 70 and 135 CE. Historians contest it. Jewish communities existed in the Aegean, Greece, Asia Minor, Cyrenaica, Italy and Egypt from as early as the third century BCE. **Erich Gruen** argues that compulsory dislocation explains only a fraction of a diaspora already well established; Howard Adelman and Elazar Barkan call the expulsion account "misleading". Roman victories sent many captives into slavery, but did not create the dispersion.

Later expulsions redrew the map. Spain's Alhambra Decree of 1492 expelled between 40,000 and 100,000 Jews, and Sultan Bayezid II welcomed Sephardi exiles to the Ottoman Empire. Pogroms, discriminatory laws and poverty drove more than two million Jews from the Russian Empire between 1880 and 1920, the great majority to the United States and smaller numbers to Britain and Palestine.

## What Makes a Diaspora?

For centuries "diaspora" meant the Jewish dispersion. **Simon Dubnow** introduced the broader social-science sense in his entry "Diaspora" in the 1931 *Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences*, and by the mid-1950s English writers applied the word to other dispersed peoples. Diaspora studies then grew rapidly, and the journal *Diaspora*, edited by Khachig Tölölyan, was founded in 1991.

Its first issue carried the definition that started the modern debate. The political scientist **William Safran** set out six criteria separating diasporas from ordinary migrant communities, among them a collective memory or myth of the homeland and a belief in eventual return. His model was shaped by the Jewish case, and by experience: Safran, who died in January 2026, was a Holocaust survivor born in Dresden who had spent four months in a UN displaced persons camp. **Robin Cohen**'s *Global Diasporas* (1997) widened the frame, arguing that a diasporic group could leave its homeland voluntarily and assimilate deeply, and sorting diasporas into victim, labour, imperial, trade and cultural types. By 2005 **Rogers Brubaker** worried that the term had itself been scattered, a "'diaspora' diaspora", stretched "essentially to any and every nameable population category that is to some extent dispersed in space". He reduced it to three criteria: dispersion, voluntary or forced; boundary maintenance; and "the orientation to a real or imagined 'homeland' as an authoritative source of value, identity and loyalty".

Others rejected the homeland at the centre altogether. **Paul Gilroy**'s *The Black Atlantic* (1993) described a black Atlantic culture combining African, American, British and Caribbean elements, a "modern political and cultural formation" that he wanted freed from the frame of the nation-state. **Brent Hayes Edwards**'s *The Practice of Diaspora* (2003) studied literature, translation and the rise of Black internationalism. The argument decides whether a diaspora is defined by a lost homeland or by the cultures its members make on the move.

## Forced Migration: Slaves and Convicts

The largest forced migrations were the slave trades. About 12.5 million Africans embarked on the Atlantic crossing and about 10.7 million arrived, as the chapter on The Atlantic Slave Trade describes. The Indian Ocean trade is harder to measure; William Gervase Clarence-Smith notes that even estimating it has been controversial. Estimates drawn from Tidiane N'Diaye and Olivier Pétré-Grenouilleau put 8 million people carried from East Africa between the seventh century and 1920, and 9 million across the Sahara. The medieval trades are discussed in the chapter on Slavery in the global Middle Ages.

States also used transportation as punishment. Britain had sent convicts to America since the early seventeenth century, and the Transportation Act of 1717 made it routine; after independence closed that outlet, the First Fleet sailed for Australia in 1787, and about 162,000 men and women were transported there before the practice ended in 1868. British India sent prisoners to the Andaman Islands, and France to French Guiana and New Caledonia. Religious persecution produced refugees long before the word was common: after Louis XIV revoked Protestant rights in 1685, Huguenots fled, and an estimated 50,000 Protestant Walloons and Huguenots reached England.

## Indenture and the Asian Migrations

When the British Empire abolished slavery, plantation owners looked to Asia for labour. In 1834 the *Atlas* carried 36 labourers from Calcutta to Mauritius, and by the end of recruitment in 1917 more than 1.6 million Indians had gone under indenture to plantation colonies from Natal to British Guiana, Trinidad and Fiji. Women were few among them. Hugh Tinker called the system *A New System of Slavery* (1974), echoing Lord John Russell's fear of 1840, and argued that its voluntariness was a legal fiction; revisionists such as David Northrup treat it as harsh but distinct contract labour in which migrants exercised some choice. The chapters on Abolition and Emancipation and on Modern South Asia follow that debate and the system's end.

Yet indenture was only a small part of Indian migration. **Sunil Amrith** estimates that about 28 million people crossed the Bay of Bengal in both directions between 1840 and 1940, Historians of Indian labour estimate that of some 30 million departures from India between 1834 and 1937, over 90 per cent were to Ceylon, Burma and Malaya, not to the indenture colonies. Most went outside formal indenture, often recruited by a headman-overseer under the *kangani* system.

Chinese labour followed a parallel path. In 1847 two ships carried Chinese workers from Amoy (Xiamen) to Havana, and Macau became the hub of what Europeans called the "coolie" trade, a term now regarded as a slur; it was also known as the "pig trade". About 215,000 Chinese were shipped from Macau alone between 1851 and 1874, to all destinations but mainly Cuba and Peru; this is a different measure from the 140,000 to 150,000 Chinese taken to Cuba before the mid-1870s cited in the chapter on The Second Industrial Revolution. Average mortality on voyages to Cuba in 1847–1859 was about 15 per cent, and more than two-thirds of the Chinese who arrived in Peru between 1849 and 1874 died before their contracts ended. The historian Evelyn Hu-DeHart framed the question for Cuba in the title of a 1994 article: "Free Labor or Neoslavery?"

q: Why do historians dispute the story that the Jewish diaspora began with Roman expulsions after 70 CE?
a*: Because Jewish communities around the Mediterranean already existed from as early as the third century BCE, and scholars such as Erich Gruen argue that forced dislocation explains only a fraction of an established diaspora.
a: Because Rome never fought a war in Judaea.
x: Roman forces defeated Jewish revolts in 70 and 135 CE and sent many captives into slavery.
a: Because the word "diaspora" was invented only in 1931.
x: The word was first recorded in the Septuagint; Dubnow's 1931 entry introduced its broader social-science sense.
a: Because all Jews left the land of Israel in 722 BCE.
x: The Assyrians deported many Israelites in 722 BCE, but Jewish life continued in the land of Israel and later had two centres, Babylonia and the land of Israel.
hint: Look at where Jewish communities already lived before the Roman wars.
why: The diaspora grew over centuries through deportation, trade and settlement; the Roman victories added to it but did not create it.
---
q: According to historians of Indian labour, where did most departures from India go between 1834 and 1937?
a: To the sugar colonies of the Caribbean under indenture.
x: Indenture carried more than 1.6 million Indians, a small share of the total.
a: To the United States through Ellis Island.
x: Ellis Island was an American immigration station; Amrith's figures point to the lands around the Bay of Bengal.
a*: To Ceylon, Burma and Malaya, mostly outside formal indenture.
a: To Britain after the Second World War.
x: Large-scale post-war Caribbean and South Asian migration to Britain, symbolised by the Windrush in 1948, came after this period.
hint: Think of the Bay of Bengal.
why: Over 90 per cent of departures went across the Bay of Bengal, many under the kangani system rather than indenture.

## Three Great Streams, 1840–1940

The century after 1840 saw migration on an enormous scale, and how historians count it has changed the story. The familiar version is European. From 1815 to 1932 about sixty million people left Europe, mainly for areas of European settlement in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Siberia; the chapter on the Second Industrial Revolution notes that more than 30 million Europeans went to the United States alone between 1836 and 1914. Ireland's Great Famine of 1845–1852 killed roughly a million people and sent over a million abroad.

In 2004 the historian **Adam McKeown** argued that this picture was lopsided. By his estimates, roughly 55 to 58 million people moved from Europe to the Americas between 1846 and 1940; 48 to 52 million moved from India and southern China to Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean rim and the South Pacific; and 46 to 51 million moved from Russia and north-east Asia into Manchuria, Siberia, Central Asia and Japan. Asian migration, in other words, was comparable to the Atlantic. He also argued that global migration reached new peaks in the 1920s, so that ending the "age of mass migration" in 1914 is a European habit, and that separate migration systems were as much the work of politics as of economics. The ranges are his reconstructions, not counts, and critics such as Prabhu Mohapatra questioned his framing; but they put Asia back into a story long told from the Atlantic.

Behind the great numbers were family strategies and village networks. Between 1890 and 1920, according to Akram Fouad Khater, over a third of the peasants of Mount Lebanon left for the Americas. They built the *Mahjar*, the emigrant world: the first American Arabic-language newspaper, *Kawkab America*, appeared in New York in 1892, and Kahlil Gibran became the most influential of its poets. Others settled in West and Central Africa. Estimates of today's Lebanese diaspora, from about 4 million to more than 14 million, show mainly how hard diasporas are to count. Fujian and Guangdong, and above all counties such as Taishan, were major sources of Chinese emigrants, and Sun Yat-sen raised funds for his revolution among overseas Chinese communities.

How should these migrants be understood? In 1885 E. G. Ravenstein set out "laws of migration": most migrants move short distances, every flow produces a counter-flow, and migration proceeds by stages. The classic "push–pull" model is usually credited to Everett Lee, writing in 1966, though some scholars trace the idea back to Ravenstein. For the United States, **Oscar Handlin**'s *The Uprooted* (1951), which won the Pulitzer Prize, cast immigrants as uprooted peasants and stressed rupture and alienation. John Bodnar's *The Transplanted* (1985) answered with a title that summed up the opposite case: continuity, families and communities carried across the ocean.

## Paper Walls: Exclusion, Passports and Refugees

As movement grew, states learned to stop it, and they learned first on Asians. The United States' Page Act of 1875, aimed at Asian contract labourers and at women presumed to be prostitutes, in practice kept out almost all Chinese women and with them family settlement; the Chinese Exclusion Act, signed on 6 May 1882, was the first major American law to bar a specific national group, and was repealed only in 1943. Canada taxed Chinese entrants from 1885 and in 1923 barred almost all Chinese immigration; Chinese Canadians called 1 July, the day the law took effect, "Humiliation Day". Australia's Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 used a dictation test in a European language chosen by the officer, as the chapter on Australia describes, and the chapter on Modern America tells how the Immigration Act of 1924 banned immigration from Asia and set national-origin quotas that lasted until 1965. In *Melancholy Order*, McKeown argued that modern border control itself grew out of these efforts to control Asian migration from the 1880s.

The First World War generalised the border. In the decades before 1914 passports were mostly not required for travel within Europe; during the war governments introduced them for security and to keep skilled workers at home. In 1920 a League of Nations conference in Paris agreed a standard booklet design, and the modern passport was standardised. **John Torpey** titled the opening chapter of *The Invention of the Passport* (2000) "Coming and Going: On the State Monopolization of the Legitimate 'Means of Movement'".

The same years made the modern refugee. In 1915 and 1916, at the orders of Talaat Pasha, Ottoman authorities sent an estimated 800,000 to 1.2 million Armenians on death marches into the Syrian desert; deaths are estimated at 600,000 to 1.5 million. Survivors formed much of the modern Armenian diaspora, the *spyurk*. When the Soviet government revoked the citizenship of Russians abroad in 1921, including some 800,000 refugees of the Civil War, Fridtjof Nansen convened a conference in Geneva in 1922 that created an identity certificate for the stateless, the **Nansen passport**. It was extended to Armenians in 1924, and about 450,000 were issued in all.

## Unmixing Peoples

The twentieth century made whole populations move to fit new borders. Under the convention signed at Lausanne in 1923, about 1.2 million Greek Orthodox Christians and 355,000 to 400,000 Muslims were exchanged between Turkey and Greece, defined by religion rather than language. Between 1944 and 1950, 12 to 14.6 million Germans fled or were expelled from eastern Europe. The Partition of India in 1947 displaced between 12 and 20 million people by different estimates, as the chapter on Partition describes, and in 1948 some 700,000 to 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled, the *Nakba* whose memory runs through the chapters on The Making of the Modern Middle East and on Jerusalem. The UN created UNRWA for them in 1949; more than 5.9 million Palestinians are now registered as refugees, since descendants of male refugees can register.

The response was meant to be temporary. UNHCR was set up in 1950 for only three years, and the 1951 Refugee Convention, limited to events before 1 January 1951, defined a refugee as someone who,

```quote
owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country
1951 Refugee Convention · Article 1A(2) · 28 July 1951
```

The 1967 Protocol removed its time and geographic limits. The end of empires and new wars added further flights: about 800,000 *pieds-noirs* left Algeria for France in 1962; Idi Amin expelled Uganda's South Asians in 1972; and almost 800,000 Vietnamese "boat people" reached other countries between 1975 and 1995, while UNHCR estimates that 200,000 to 250,000 died at sea. Some now argue that courts have stretched the Convention; defenders see it as the core of refugee protection.

## Guest Workers and Post-Colonial Migration

West Germany needed labour, all the more after the Berlin Wall cut off workers from the East in 1961. It signed recruitment agreements with Italy in 1955, Turkey in 1961 and seven other countries, and stopped recruitment in 1973. About half the Turkish guest workers went home; many others brought their families and stayed. Writing in 1965 about Italian workers in Switzerland, Max Frisch put the lesson in a line, as it is often quoted, "Man hat Arbeitskräfte gerufen, und es kommen Menschen": we asked for workers, and human beings came. In the United States, the Bracero Program brought Mexican farmworkers north from 1942 to 1964, as the chapter on Modern America describes.

Empire brought its subjects to the metropole. The *Empire Windrush* docked at Tilbury in June 1948 with 1,027 passengers, most from the Caribbean; until the Commonwealth Immigrants Act of 1962, Britain had no immigration control on citizens of the UK and Colonies.

In the Gulf states, migrant workers come under the **kafala** system, which ties a worker's residence and employment to a sponsor. In every Gulf state migrants are more than half the workforce. Kafala's origins are disputed: Gilbert Beaugé traced it to Bedouin customs of protecting visitors, Omar AlShehabi (2021) to British colonial labour control. Qatar announced several times between 2014 and 2021 that kafala had been abolished, claims human-rights organisations rejected; Saudi Arabia announced its abolition in June 2025, though how far the change reached domestic workers remained unclear.

```checkpoint
q: What did Adam McKeown's 2004 estimates of migration between 1846 and 1940 suggest?
a: That European emigration dwarfed all other long-distance migration.
x: McKeown's point was the reverse: Asian streams were comparable in size to the Atlantic one.
a*: That two Asian streams, into Southeast Asia and into Manchuria, Siberia and Central Asia, were each roughly comparable to the 55–58 million who moved from Europe to the Americas.
a: That long-distance migration ended in 1914.
x: He argued that global migration reached new peaks in the 1920s.
a: That most migrants were refugees from war.
x: His three streams were long-distance circuits out of Europe, India and southern China, and Russia and north-east Asia, not counts of war refugees.
hint: Count the streams, not just the Atlantic.
why: McKeown's ranges, which are his estimates, put Asian migration on the same scale as European migration.
---
q: What was the Nansen passport?
a: The first British booklet passport, introduced in 1914.
x: That was a British national passport; the Nansen passport was international.
a: A visa for guest workers entering West Germany.
x: West Germany's recruitment agreements began only in 1955.
a: A document created by the 1951 Refugee Convention.
x: The Nansen passport was issued from 1922 to 1938, long before the 1951 Convention.
a*: An identity document for stateless refugees, created at a 1922 conference convened by Fridtjof Nansen after the Soviet government stripped Russians abroad of citizenship.
hint: Think of the League of Nations and the Russian Civil War.
why: About 450,000 were issued, and the scheme was extended to Armenians in 1924.

## Migration and Diaspora Today

UN DESA counted a record 304 million international migrants in 2024, about 3.7 per cent of the world's people and almost double the figure of 1990; almost half are women and girls. The share has stayed between 2 and 4 per cent for half a century, a point **Hein de Haas** presses in *How Migration Really Works* (2023), and a large share of migration runs between developing countries. De Haas argues that development at first increases emigration, because the poorest cannot afford to move, and that migrants come disproportionately from better-off groups. That challenges the push–pull picture. De Haas also led the 2020 edition of *The Age of Migration*, first published by Stephen Castles and Mark Miller in 1993.

Forced displacement is counted separately. UNHCR's *Global Trends* report of June 2026 counted 117.8 million people forcibly displaced at the end of 2025, down from 123.2 million a year earlier, the first fall in a decade. The chapters on Modern Syria and on Modern Conflicts since 1991 follow the Syrian and Ukrainian exiles.

Migrants also send money. The World Bank estimated in December 2024 that low- and middle-income countries received about \$685 billion in remittances in 2024, led by India and Mexico, as the chapter on Globalization describes. Diasporas are political actors too: Yossi Shain and Tamara Cofman Wittes note that scholars now see ethnic diasporas as "inevitable" and "endemic" features of the international system, able to organise in host states and press homeland politics. India marks Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, Overseas Indian Day, each 9 January, the date of Gandhi's return from South Africa in 1915, and its diaspora, 35.4 million people in 2024, is the world's largest. The old tension remains: states claim the right to decide who enters, while migrants, as they have since the first dispersal, keep moving and making new worlds.
